Finished Dataframes - 
dt_5_finished -- Extracts mean and standard deviation measurements of the sensor readings. Data presented
is wide but tidy, complete with descriptive variable names and variable element names where applicable.

pt2 -- Provides an average measurement for each subject and activity.

Variables -

"subject"
  Class: numeric
  Subject Number - 30 anonymous individuals participated in the experiment
    1, 2, 3, ... 30

"activity_name"
  Class: character
  Type of Activity - The 30 subjects were instructed to perform six activities
    LAYING
    SITTING
    STANDING
    WALKING
    WALKING DOWNSTAIRS
    WALKING UPSTAIRS

Sensor variables
  Class: numeric; See original data files for units.
  The remaining variables are readings from the subjects' phone accelerometer and gyrometer. All variable names are
  prefaced by their domain. "time" refers to time domain, while "frequency" refers to frequency domain.
  
  Thereafter, the movement parameter is specified. Body acceleration, derived from original variable name including
  ("BodyAcc"), gravity acceleration ("GravityAcc"), linear acceleration ("BodyAccJerk"), gyroscope ("BodyGyro"),
  and angular velocity ("BodyGyroJerk").
  
  After follows whether the variable is a mean ("mean()") or standard deviation ("standard deviation()") measurement, 
  and then if the variable is not a magnitude measurement, the axial direction of the movement (X, Y, Z) is specified.
